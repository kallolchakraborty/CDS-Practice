VDM - BASIC

To standardize the CDS view technical development, SAP came up with the Best Practices with @VDM annotation. 
This is to standardize the development process and if religiously followed in the organization, it will very 
easy to maintain these technical artifacts with no issues and confusions.  Looking at this annotations, one 
can figure out everything about the CDS view. This annotation has absolutely NO impact on the behavior or 
output of the CDS view rather it just show below features;

    1. What kind of data the CDS view expose.
    2. What is the category of the CDS view.

@VDM annotation is further broken down into the type of views.  There are 4 type of CDS views can be developed:
    1. BASIC : They are also called INTERFACE views and for naming standards SAP use ‘I’ in between of the view name : *_I_*
    2. COMPOSITE : For naming standards, SAP use ‘CO’ in between of the view name: *_CO_*
    3. CONSUMPTION : For naming standards, SAP start the view name with ‘C’:  C_*
    4. PRIVATE : For naming standards, SAP start the view name with ‘P’:  P_*
